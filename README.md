Hi there! This is Sri Devi C R!
I'm a passionate Computer Science Engineering student on the lookout for an entry-level programming role that can grow alongside my studies. I love diving into new programming languages and enjoy solving problems with code. My communication skills are strong, whether it’s talking through ideas or writing them down clearly. I thrive in team settings and am happy to take on leadership when needed.

I’m also a Bharatanatyam dancer, dedicated to preserving and sharing the beauty of traditional Indian culture through my art. 

Always eager to learn and embrace new challenges, I’m excited about where my journey will take me!
