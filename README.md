Hi there! This is Sri Devi C R!
I'm a passionate Computer Science Engineering student 💻 on the lookout for an entry-level programming role that can grow alongside my studies.
I love diving into new programming languages and enjoy solving problems with code.✨
My communication skills are strong, whether it’s talking through ideas 🗣️ or writing them down clearly. ✍️
I thrive in team settings and am happy to take on leadership when needed. ✨

I’m also a Bharatanatyam dancer, dedicated to preserving and sharing the beauty of traditional Indian culture through my art. 🎶

Always eager to learn and embrace new challenges, I’m excited about where my journey will take me!😆
